# lis.py

Can various models correctly translate Norvig's `lis.py` into C?
Maybe c99 (as in agondev C compiler)?

### lis-py3

Claude 3.6 Sonnet Thinking. I think the UNION compiles, but doesn't work right.

- lis-p1.cNope Gemini Pro 2.5 was unable to handle the translation assignment - lis-p2.cNope Claude 3.7 sonnet thinking was unable to handle the translation assignment

- lis-py3.c was unable to produce and useful interaction. Did not investigate.
