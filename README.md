ideas for the Agon Light 2

ZeeEighty - an adventure in lisp, emacs, and the z80.
Specifically, the Agon Light 2 from Olimex.

Currently messing with a Lisp implementation for the Agon Light. 
UDecided to use the [agondev c compiler](https://github.com/AgonPlatform/agondev) which seems to be actively developed by @envenomator and shows great promise.
Most developed version is [klc-3.c](src/klisp/klispc/src/klc-3.c)

- Lisp from Nothing by Holm might be a way to start.
- Is there a small emacs in c which launches an elisp interpreter?
- Small-C - would it work as a bootstrap compiler?
- agon-utilities
- mebbe a small lisp in z80 asm
  - there are some small Lisps like `jart/sectorlisp` in x86 asm and C
  - there is also a `xorvoid/sectorc`, a very small C in x86 asm
  - also a `cesarblum/sectorforth` in x86 asm
  - Nils Holm has a bootstrapping lisp system in `Lisp from Nothing`
  
Messing about in the Project board.

### when I started

I had four main ideas for sidecar passion projects for Spring25 cohort.

- Piro360 - my old chestnut
- Analyzing a sailboat data set [Sailing Boats Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/opendatasource/sailing-boats)
- WhitherThen - an app already written
- ZeeEighty - an adventure in lisp, emacs, and the z80

Obviously, there was a leading contender for this timeframe.
